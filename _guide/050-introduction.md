# Introduction

It is the year 852, counted from the founding of the imperial city of Heliconium, and the Helic empire which collapsed several hundred years ago.\
The Free City of Blackwater on the fringes of the old Helic empire, sits on the western edge of the Covari Sea, nestled between steep hills and the River Blackwater roughly 20 miles upstream from the river’s mouth.
The river and the city both are named for the dark gray gravel and silt, that forms the bed of the river.
Blackwater lies in a hilly temperate coastal zone among a mix of hardwoods and conifers.
Summers are warm and the days are long.
Autumn’s are typically windy and chilly with spectacular changes in foliage color.
Winter is cold and damp with a mix of snow and rain.
Spring is usually wet and muddy with beautiful flowers.

A wealthy, walled town of approximately 30,000 residents, the Free City of Blackwater controls a strategic point where the River Blackwater passes through low but steep hills in its transition from the fertile plains out the Covari coast.
Boasting many large churches and temples, cobblestone streets, and an impressive castle on the hillside overlooking the city, Blackwater is a prosperous river-side trading center with most of its buildings being 2-3 story stone structures with plaster facades and tile roofs.

Blackwater serves as the cultural, military, and political center for the surrounding area encompassing nearly 2,500 square miles.
Within the sway of Earl Froderek of Blackwater are the villages of Northunder, Coldcreek, Ferton, and Manor Post.
The Earl’s title is not due to nobility.
The position is elected by the City Assembly and the title is a holdover from old imperial days.
Earl Froderek has held the position for nearly 20 years.
