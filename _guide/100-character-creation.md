# Character Creation

The player characters are from one of the areas surrounding Blackwater or the City of Blackwater itself.

The player’s party have been hired by Gavin Monkrief, owner of Skeleton Key Books and Maps (see #34 [K4]) on the Player’s Map of Blackwater, pp. 46) to search for the lost Tome of Asturias.
Mr. Monkrief has recently uncovered some clues that lead him to in the crypt of Lady Dunwich located the ruins of the Maiden’s cloister in the foothills to the west of Northunder.

See recommended Party Roles and Skills on pp. 45

## Starting Points

Player Characters in the Blackwater campaign are created with 150 points, up to 75 points of disadvantages, including 5 points of quirks.
10 additional points can be gained by creating an in-depth character background which includes information such as: age, place of birth, family details, reasons for quirks, previous employment, favored Deity, reasons for being an adventurer, and the like.
5 more points can be earned by creating a detailed character description including, not only the obvious: appearance, demeanor, hair color, eye color, weight, and skin tone; but also, things such as favored styles of dress, mannerisms, hair style, ornamentation, etc.

## Character Races

[GURPS Fantasy] is the defining standard for common races with the lands known to the environs of Blackwater.
Races allowed for PCs include:

* Humans
* Elves
* Dwarves
* Halflings
* Half-Elves

There are other races described in GURPS Fantasy that exist, for the most part, as described in GURPS Fantasy, but are not ideal candidates for PCs. Some of them may be allowed as PCs, under certain conditions. They Include:

* Centaurs 
* Fauns
* Giants
* Orcs
* Gnomes
* Pixies
* Sprites

No other races listed in GURPS Fantasy exist in Blackwater, at least not as described there.
See the Races section of this guide on page 11 for more information.

## Magic

Mana levels are normal by default within the known world, with variations and aspected mana levels being common.
Magic is uncommon and viewed with suspicion and fear by a large number of people.
Mages are rare, except among Player Characters and significant NPCs.

All forms of magery discussed in the [GURPS Magic] sourcebook are allowed, including Improvised Magic, Rune Magic, and Knacks.
All variants of the magery advantage are allowed.
No mage player can purchase higher than magery level 3; however this does not include any levels of magery that are granted from racial packages.
All colleges listed from within the Magic sourcebook are allowed except the Technological college.

Mages are uncommon in Blackwater, with less than 1 in 1,000 people being magically active (having at least magery 0 advantage).
Obviously, this doesn’t apply to elves, but does include all other races.
The mages of Blackwater have organized themselves into a mages’ guild, called the Order of the Magi, that regulates magical activity within Blackwater and its surroundings.
The Order is led by a circle of masters, and a Grand Master that is elected and serves as the magical advisor to the Earl.

Mage characters must either be a member of the guild or a renegade mage.
See Magic on p.19.

## Martial Arts

All realistic martial arts maneuvers are allowed.
Karate and Judo may also be learned by any character.
For all maneuvers, and the karate and judo skills, a rationale for knowing them must be included in the character’s background and a 5 point unusual background cost must be paid unless they are a member of the Brotherhood (see pp 17).
Brawling, boxing and wrestling may be learned normally by any character and maneuvers based on those skills may be acquired after character generation through attempted game uses of the defaults for the maneuvers.

## Literacy

All PCs are native fluent in 1 spoken language of their choice.
Illiteracy is the norm in Blackwater, only about 30% of the population can read.
Literacy in other languages and spoken fluency must be purchased as separate advantages.
See Languages on pp. 33 for more specifics.
