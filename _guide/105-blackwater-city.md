## Ferton  
![Ferton](../maps/Ferton Map.png){:.float-right}  

Ferton, a collection of shacks, rundown buildings, and storage yards, lies across the river from the city of Blackwater. Originally a ferry landing for people heading north out of the city, Ferton has become the slum of Blackwater, where the city watch turns a blind eye.  There are a number of homes, and  businesses in Ferton including: the Loggers Union, The Giant Halfling Smokehouse, Red Goat Tallow Shop, Griswold Millhouse, and Millastre's Glass Blowers.  

### Garrison  
A city Watch garrison (#1) was established in Ferton three years ago, but hasn't done much to change the reputation of the enclave.  The garrison is typically less than a dozen men, and are primarily there to regulate commerce traffic across the bridge.  

There has been debate in the City Council about levying a property tax in Ferton and / or a bridge toll to pay for enhanced policing of the area and fund needed bridge repairs.  

### Cock & Balls Inn  
<img align="left" src="../images/Cock and Balls Sign.png" height="200">  

The Cock and Balls Inn (#2) is a large 2 story (plus a walkout basement) structure on the East side of the Grand Bridge in Ferton.  It is the primary location for lodging on the north side of the Blackwater, as well as a favorite meeting location for folks wishing to conduct business outside of Blackwater's watchful eyes.  The Inn has dozens of sleeping rooms of varying sizes and sleeping configurations, as well as private meeting and dinning rooms.  

The Inn has a well appointed bar with an impressive selection of Shanaran and Plamarise wines, Blackwater beers, Belorum ales, and Northunder meades.  The kitchen is known for humble, but reliable and filling fare.  The staff is known for both their discretion and their lack of discretion (for the right price).  Even thought the Watch has established a garrison just across the street, they seem to be miles away, and rarely come into the Inn except in off-duty capacity.

## Main Gate and the West End 

### Main Gate (#4)  
The main gate to Blackwater faces roughly west along the slow southernly bend of the Blackwater river, looking out across fields and forests to the snow-capped Carpathian mountains in the distance.  The gate is typically manned by a dozen guards monitoring people coming and going in the City.  The wall is roughly 10 yards thick and the main gate tunnel has a strong steel portcullis at both ends.  In addition to the dozen guards that man the main gate entrance tunnel, another dozen man the towers and battlements  atop walls.

Off to the side of the gate, on the outside of the city, is a station where they:  
* Verify licenses for horses, wagons, and weapons
* Inspect possible enchanted items
* Question any suspiciouos looking travellers
* Peacebond weapons

### West End  
The West End is generally considered to be the area within the walls between the **Main Gate** and **Waterwheel Road**.  The West End tends to be a relatively affluent section of town with a number of quality merchants located in the area, well maintained buildings.

## The Old Quarter

The Old Quarter is, as the name implies, the oldest section of Blackwater.  The buildings tend to be smaller and more cramped together than in the rest of the city.  The poorest residents of Blackwater tend to live in this district.  

The boundaries of the Old Quarter are somewhat irregular, defined in the West by a path along **Fleet Street** south to **Main Street**, then West to **Sweet Street** and along **Mother's Way** to **Privet Drive**.  The southern edge of The Old Quarter follows **Justive Street** to **High Street** and back to **Main Street**.  The distrect ends along Merchant Lane in the East and **Blackwater Ave** / **The Warfs** in the North.
