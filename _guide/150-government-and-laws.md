# Blackwater Government and Laws

Most laws are written down in the Blackwater Codices, maintained in the city courthouse.
Laws are passed by a 2/3 vote of the assembly and must be approved by the Earl.
Most laws are focused on either public protection or tax collection.
Some laws have prescribed punishments, but in most cases the judges have extensive latitude in metering out punishments.

## City Assembly

Assembly members are elected by general vote.
All legal citizens and residents may vote for city council membership.
Only citizens are eligible to be members of the council.
There are 15 general city assembly seats.
In addition, each of the 10 guild masters (except the Order of the Magi) gets a voting seat (Bakers, Candle makers, Carpenters, Cobblers, Glassiers, Leather workers, Masons, Merchants, Shipwrights, and Smiths) for a total of 25 seats on the Assembly.

## City Watch

The City Watch of Blackwater is well funded and well trained.
They provide both professional soldier defense of the city and surrounding land as well as police enforcement of laws among the population.
In addition to manning the walls and gates, they patrol the streets, surrounding countryside, and river, as well as investigate all crimes.

## Citizens, Residents, and Visitors

Denizens of the City of Blackwater are legally grouped into one of three classes:

**Citizens** are property owners (buildings, parts of buildings or land) within the city.

**Residents** have established permanent living quarters and paid taxes (residents are probationary their first year)

**Visitors** have been granted a one month visit tag and must renew monthly to stay in town legally.
Most inns require a valid visitor tag to rent a room.

All are issued small, brass ID tags with relevant info (address etc) stamped into them.

* Citizens are free
* Residents must pay $10 per year
* Visitors must pay $10 per month
* Residents and citizens may also get a "hunters" stamp on their ID, so they don't have to pay the weapon tax on bows and axes, but they still must be peace bonded and unstrung while inside city walls.

Watchmen may ask to see anyone’s ID at any time for any reason.

## City Entry and Exit

All persons entering the City of Blackwater are expected to show proof of residency or proof of taxes paid.
All merchandise brought into the city is taxed. Players will be asked if they have any hidden weapons, magical or enchanted devices, or goods for sale.
If they do, they will have their weapons taxed and peace bonded, their goods taxed, and their names are recorded, and magic items recorded.

Members of the Order of the Magi are frequently stationed at each gate to help the guards spot magical items, people or creatures and evaluated if they are safe for entry into the city.
Unsafe items will be confiscated and possibly returned or not depending on the perceived threat of the item.
In cases where suspected magic item cannot be deemed safe, it will be impounded for further inspection by the order.
The owner of the item will be given a brass tag with a number matching a tag affixed to the item in question.
The owner can claim their item from the Orders office, if it is deemed safe.

Humans, Dwarves, Halflings, and Elves (although few Elves choose to) are allowed free entry into Blackwater.
Most other races will be stopped and questioned extensively at any town gate.

## Weapons and Armor Laws

### Weapons

All metal or edged weapons larger than a small knife must be peacebonded while within the city walls.
Guards at any city gates will require anyone entering the city with weapons to have them peacbonded.
There is a tax on each weapon peacebonded of $2 per pound of the weapon.
Bows and crossbows must be unstrung while within city gates.

Peacebonding consists of a red cord tied around the weapon and closed with a melted lead seal.
The cord is tied around the hilt of the blade and through or around the scabbard in such a way that is impossible (or at least very difficult) to remove the weapon from the sheath without breaking the peacebond.
For weapons with no scabbard or sheath, and heavy piece of leather is wrapped around the head or blade and cinched on the with red cord and sealed.
For arrows or bolts, the leather is wrapped around the head, the arrows are cinched together with a red cord around the leather wrap, and then sealed with the hot lead.

### Armor

Armor may not be worn within the city walls.
Anyone entering the city must remove their armor and carry it.
The City Watch will provide rope net bags to carry the armor.

### Violations

Punishment for violating the Arms and Armor laws carries the following punishments:

* 1st Offense: $100 fine or 7 days in jail or 7 lashes.
  Offending weapon is re- peacebonded and returned to owner after punishment is served.
* 2nd Offense: $500 fine and/or 10 days in jail and/or 10 lashes [two out of three].
  Offending weapon is confiscated permanently.
* 3rd Offense: 20 lashes plus the perpetrator is branded with an “X” on his forehead, forfeits ALL property, weapons and armor, and is banished from the City (but not necessarily the surrounding lands) permanently.

## Other Violent Crimes

Brawling is a crime, and, if convicted, punishable by 2 weeks of hard labor.

Attacking someone with a weapon is typically punishable by a heavy fine, hard labor, and lashes depending on the severity of the injury done.

Killing someone, intentionally or unintentionally, is obviously a crime.
Punishments vary widely depending on the circumstances of the death, but can include combinations of imprisonment, flogging, banishment, and execution.

## Public Disruption or Destruction

This is a broad catch all law used to arrest and punish anyone who is believed to be interfering with the orderly running of the town.
Punishments can range from a small fine and / or a few days in jail, to some period of forced labor or up to extensive torture, disfigurement or death, depending on the gravity of the offence.

## Use of Magic

Magic and spell casting are not inherently illegal in Blackwater, unless they are used to violate another law.
However, the Order takes an active interest in all magic used within the city and will intervene in any magic use it deems unsafe or undesirable.
Members of the Order also occasionally augment the city watch in cases of flagrant, unknown, or particularly nefarious magic.

## Horses

Horses must be licensed for use on Blackwater streets.
Visitors may stable horses without paying licensing fee.
If visitors wish to ride their horses in town, they must pay a “Riding Tax” of $100 per month.
They will be given a bronze tag attached to their saddle that is good for one month.
Residents can pay $300 per year tax to ride a horse in town.

## Schooling

Blackwater does not have publicly funded schools, however there are a number of private schools and tutors.
Schooling is not compulsory for any children and many are taught at home or just learn enough practical mathematics for their trades.

The Church of the Seven runs 2 primary schools and 1 secondary school.
One primary school is across from the Maiden’s Sept (#12, E11) orphanage on Sword Street.
The other is between the Mother’s Sept (#36, J8) and the Palace of Justice (#33, J10).
The secondary school is on Pious street near the Smith’s Sept (#18, G8).

The Mason’s guild runs an academy that takes promising students between the ages of seven and ten and trains them in mathematics, geometry, logic, engineering and architecture.
Those that successfully complete the course work are accepted to become apprentice masons.
The mason’s academy is located in the Mason’s Guild building on Mason’s alley across from the Magum Sanctorum (#47, L6).

The Merchant’s guild also runs a secondary school where they teach languages, mathematics, law, philosophy, and economics.
The school is attached to the Merchant Guild offices at the corner of Main Street and Merchant Lane (L7).

The Blackwater University offers advanced studies of Philosophy, History, Alchemy, Logic, Mathematics, Languages, Biology, Engineering, and Economics.
