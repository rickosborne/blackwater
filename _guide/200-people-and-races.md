# People and Races

The city of Blackwater is populated largely by Humans.  Several hundred Halflings and Dwarves also reside within the city.  A few dozen Elves also reside in the city at any given time, but rarely permanently.  In addition, Strig from the north, Plamarise from the south, and merchants from across the Covari are frequently seen in Blackwater.
The City collects a census of all legal residents every 10 years, as of the last census (5 years ago) there were just over 32,000 residents in the city of Blackwater.

## Humans - Strig

The Strig are a rugged, technologically deprived group of human tribes living in the northlands, a vast untamed wilderness north of Blackwater.  The land is populated with immense, deep dark forests of evergreen and hardwood, broken by vast rolling plains of hard, barren soil.  Cold and forbidding, the northlands are home to only the hardiest of races. 

Sometimes called half-giants, Strig tend to be massive by normal human standards, frequently towering over 7 feet tall and weighing over 300 lbs.  Their hair tends to be dark and wavy.  Strig men always grow long moustaches and commonly accompany them with a full beard.  Strig men grow their moustaches as early in the adolescence as possible.  A thick, full, long moustache is a sign of manliness and virulence among the Strig.  Strig men would rather cut off their left hand than have their face shaven.  Strig women do not cut their hair until after they are married and even after marriage is typically worn long, most commonly in a thick braid down the center of their back.  Light colored hair is considered a curse or a bad omen among the Strig.

In combat Strig are fierce warriors, known for fearless and merciless attacks.  The men of the northlands disdain shields, in favor of two-handed weapons or multiple weapons.  Strig warriors are typically much more concerned with mauling the enemy’s bodies than with protecting their own.  Among the Strig, it is common to say the Prayer of the Dead to Morgoth, the Strig god of war and honor, before entering a battle.  
<img align="right" src="../images/Strig Face.jpg" height="400">  
*I am dead  
My life is forfeit  
Only through victory  
May I reclaim my life.*

*I am dead  
From this moment on  
I live no longer  
My family may grieve for me  
My brothers may sing for me  
And my enemies may tremble before me*  
 
*I am dead  
Into battle I walk  
That I may claim my victory  
That I may claim the lives of my enemies  
That I may reclaim my own life*  

Strig favor silver jewelry and tattoos as forms of body ornamentation.  Earrings are common among both men and women.  Almost all Strig have their tribes marking inked into the left forearm of each boy upon his ascension to manhood, many have other tattoos as well.  Women do not have their tribe markings tattooed upon them until after marriage.  Inter-tribe marriages are more common than intra-tribe marriages, thus married Strig women have the tribe of their husband tattooed onto their flesh following the wedding.  Warriors among the more aggressive tribes also use ritual scarring.

Strig are almost always illiterate and speak Schepal as their native language.

It costs 35 points to play a Strig Barbarian.

## Dwarves

Dwarves are a race of miners, metalworkers, and craftsmen. They live underground, which is their workplace and protection from enemies. Dwarves are small but strong and enduring, with highly developed combat skills. They may become alchemists or specialize in enchanting, if they are magically gifted, but few dwarves practice other sorts of magic. Many have Magic Resistance.

Dwarves might be only 2/3 as tall as humans, but they are much longer lived, with a nose for gold and a flair for all forms of craftsmanship. Dwarves often live in underground halls, and their eyes are adapted to dim light. Many dwarves have Miserliness, but this is not a racial trait.
Virtually all of the Dwarves in the area of Blackwater hail from the Clan Belor and are fairly common visitors to Blackwater.  The Dwarves of Belor are known as skilled craftsmen, miners, and merchants.  

There are stories of other tribes of Dwaves scattered through the world, but the Dwarves of Belor do not share this information with outsiders.  

The Dwarf racial template is described in GURPS Fantasy pp. 107, costing 35 points.  
Attribute Modifiers: HT+1 [10].

## Elves

Elves are the quintessential fantasy race: very similar to humans (and cross-fertile with them), but exceptionally beautiful, ageless, and naturally magical. Some descriptions make them superb artists, while others say that they ultimately lack creativity; this version avoids either option, while making them sensitive to the beauty of landscapes and living creatures. Elves normally live in forested areas. They use their magic to enhance the growth and fertility of their forests. Survival rolls in an elven forest are at +1 or better. They find clearing the land repugnant, and since elven leaders have centuries of skill in warfare, elven forests tend to stay forested.  

Elves are comparatively slender, relying on speed and agility more than raw strength. Determine their height normally from their ST and add 2”.   

The Elf racial template is described in GURPS Fantasy pp. 108 and costs 70 points  
Attribute Modifiers: ST-1 [-10]; DX+1 [20].

## Half-Elves

Half-Elves are a cross breed between Elves and Humans.  Half-Elves typically inherit some, but not all of their Elven parent’s traits.  Half-Elf Characters may select up to 35 points of the traits from the Elf racial package.

## Halflings

Short and fond of comfort, halflings seldom leave their farms, but those who do sometimes make surprisingly good adventurers, thanks to natural stealth, superb marksmanship, and resilient health. They’re not at their best in a stand-up fight, but make fine skirmishers, with thrown rocks, slings, bows, crossbows, or even muskets. The ability to move noiselessly through grass or underbrush also helps. Halflings seldom seek out a fight. They are fairly egalitarian, with chieftains but no kings. Many cultures expect chieftains to give feasts and hand out presents to the guests. 

By choice, halflings live underground, in shabby burrows or elaborate tunnel complexes. The ones who build aboveground are the poor. An average halfling (ST 5) stands 2’8” to 3’ tall and weighs 18 to 29 lbs. (This takes Overweight into account.) Adjust height by 1 to 2” and weight by 2 to 4 lbs. per point of ST above or below 5.
The largest concentration of Halflings in the Blackwater area is in a village the Halflings call Everglen, across the lake from Northunder.  Roughly a thousand Halflings live there farming, plying the crafts and trading with the Humans in Northunder.  Halflings also make up the largest non-human population in Blackwater, easily adapting to Human city life and customs.

The Halfling racial template is described in GURPS Fantasy pp. 109 and costs 20 points.
