# Religions 

## Faith of the Seven 

<img align="right" src="../images/7 Point Star.png" height="250">
The Faith of the Seven is the dominant religion in Blackwater. Each of the Seven aspects symbolizes a different part of life and are prayed to for different purposes. They are known as the Father, the Mother, the Maiden, the Crone, the Warrior, the Smith, and the Stranger.  

- **The Father:** The Father represents divine justice and judges the souls of the dead.  
- **The Mother:** The Mother represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. She is sometimes referred to as "the strength of women". Apart from human fertility, she also blesses crops with bountiful harvests.  
- **The Maiden:**  The Maiden represents purity, innocence, love, and beauty. She protects the chastity of virgins, as well as protecting the innocent in general.  
- **The Crone:** The Crone represents wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern. Sometimes She is depicted as blindfolded.  
- **The Warrior:** The Warrior represents strength and courage in battle.  
- **The Smith:** The Smith represents creation and craftsmanship. Grants workers the strength to continue their labors.  
- **The Stranger:** The Stranger represents death and the unknown. It is rarely prayed to.  

The Faith of the Seven considers magic un-natural and against the will of the seven.  They preach against its use, and routinely urge the creation of laws to make it a crime to use magic.  There have even been occasions where members of the Church have tried and punished suspected wizards, and witches on their own.  

Servants of the Faith are organized into roles  
•	Clerics - Administer the faith, manage the Septs and oversee the Acolytes  
•	Acolytes - Assist Clerics and Zealots, perform the routine and mundane tasks of the Faith  
•	Priests - Evangelize the Faith into the world through words and deeds   

### Priests of the Seven

<img align="left" src="../images/Priest of the Seven.jpg" height="600">  

Priests of the Seven occasionally have special abilities which are “Gifts” from the Seven. These Gifts are represented by powers from basic book and from [GURPS Powers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/). Every priest is different, but some gifts seem to manifest more frequently among Priests than other Gifts. Each Priest can receive up to 7 gifts, one from each of the Seven according to their aspect and the priest’s need. A Priest’s Gifts can change over time, growing in strength as the Priest matures in the Faith, or waning in strength if the Priest strays from the teachings of the Seven. It's also been known to happen that a Priest can lose one Gift and gain a different gift from the same aspect of the Seven.

## Brotherhood of Balance and Harmony  
<img src="../images/Yin_yang.png" align="left" height="250">   

The Brotherhood of Balance and Harmony follow the path of naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, balance.  In ancient texts, balance is associated with water through its yielding nature.  Brotherhood philosophy teaches that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony. This disruption frequently creates unintended consequences more often than the desired outcome. Monks assert that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe in order to be in balance with the natural order of things.  Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly.  “The Monk seeks to come into harmony with the universe, which itself accomplishes by nonaction."  

The members of the Brotherhood, also called Monks, may be male or female, but historically only human.  Both genders of Monks are referred to as “Brothers”.  Brothers commonly shave the side of their head and wear their remaining hair in a long braid.  Some brothers shave their head altogether. The Brotherhood’s beliefs were brought to Blackwater just before the fall of Heliconium from lands to the east on the far edge of the empire. The philosophy has slowly taken root among a small number of humans over the last century and continues to quietly spread among the human settled lands. There is a temple of the Brotherhood in hills above Blackwater, and the Brotherhood also maintains a small residence in the City for members use.  Monks are mostly reclusive but are occasionally seen preaching their religion in squares and street corners, as well as undertaking public works and charity efforts in the city and surrounding areas.

Members of the Brotherhood learn to master both their bodies and spirits by channelling their inner life force, their "Chi", and focus it in mystical ways.

## Non-Human Religions

The religions of the Elder Folk, while distinct, are all based on the concept of the Eternal, known as the Æthernum. This is envisioned as a vast, perfect consciousness, omnipresent and unchanging. The worshipper’s goal is to understand it, emulate it, and eventually become one with it. Nonsapient beings like animals, plants, and rocks are also slowly ascending to the Eternal in their own way. Indeed, their lack of conscious choice makes it easier for them, and thus the elves revere trees; the dwarves, stone. As the universe grows naturally out of primal chaos, the Æthernum is seen as both the prime creative power in the universe and as its emerging unity. Eventually, all will become the Æthernum.  

Non-Human Priests may call upon the powers of their faith using the rules in the Divine Favor sourcebook, although it is not uncommon (especially among Elves) for the priests to also be Mages.  

### Elves

Elves know and commune with the spirits, as facets of the Æthernum of the world wherever they may be found and understand the powers they wield over all living things.  Many greater spirits are known to exist. Elves find most human religious doctrines a sad, horribly constrictive, narrowly focused misunderstanding of a small part of a larger, more beautiful whole.  

The elves worship the Æthernum as it is found in animals and plants, particularly trees. The arboreal qualities they revere are slow growth, silence, endurance, living within life’s cycles, and the ability to stand firm against troubles but to bend before breaking. Elves also respect the interconnected web of ecology and strive to find their proper place in it. Most elven homes are living shelters formed from carefully tended trees and brush. They do their best to take only what they need. Indeed, most of what they consider “sinful” behavior revolves around waste. Immoral acts such as unnecessary deforestation, murder, and sloth are all defined in terms of waste.  

Thus, it’s no surprise that elves and orcs don’t get along. Elves don’t have organized religion and churches; nor do they usually proselytize. Those who have come closest to the Eternal sometimes serve as guides, advisors, and ritual leaders for others. They are called anchaliel in Mellinarathi, with a deep understanding of both magic and the Æthernum. Many humans refer to them as “dryads,” and the elves don’t seem to mind. While anchaliel are the closest thing elves have to priests, they are in no way necessary to elven worship of the Æthernum. A solitary elf who never sees a dryad can be extremely pious.   

### Dwarves

Dwarves worship the Æthernum in stone and metal. Like the elves, they practice patience and endurance. If a marble column can bear a mountain for centuries without complaint, a dwarf can endure hardships as stoically. However, they don’t believe in quietly swaying aside from great troubles. “Return with your shield or on it” translates into Dwarvish as “Better a broken axe than a bent knee.” They also don’t regard life as cyclical, but rather as a series of small, gradual changes toward an ideal state.  

Dwarves seek spiritual perfection in their craft. Creating things that endure is good. If elves despise waste, dwarves hate pointless destruction. The two are not the same thing; dwarven woodworkers will carve away nine-tenths of a block of wood to get the axe-handle they need, enhancing its value as they do so. The state of dwarf-orc relations is as bad as could be expected, considering the latter’s penchant for aimless ruination.   

Dwarves see the Æthernum in the materials under their hands. A craftsman’s product should be functional and beautiful, but most of all it should last. The great dwarven halls are as much shrines as they are homes, for every arch and column embodies the Æthernum. In dwarven culture, both civic leaders and master craftsmen fill priestly roles. The leaders perform ritual duties and officiate at weddings and similar ceremonies. The master craftsmen provide moral and spiritual guidance. Creating a whole and sound adult dwarf from the fresh ore of a newborn is seen as requiring skills very like those of metalworkers and stone-carvers.

### Halflings

Halfings worship life, particularly plant and animal life, the environment around it and the balance between it.  Most halflings do this in casual way respecting the life around them, tending to growing things and husbanding animals, but some halflings are more proactive in their beliefs.  These halflings follow the Druidic philosophy and seek to actively protect, guide and balance all natural things.
