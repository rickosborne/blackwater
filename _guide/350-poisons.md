# Poisons

## Blood Agents

### Cobra Venom

A follow-up  poison with a one- minute delay and a HT-3 roll to resist. Inflicts 2d toxic damage, repeating at hourly intervals for six cycles. A victim who loses 1/3, 1/2, or 2/3 HP has -2, -4, or -6 DX, respectively.  

**Production**: Must be harvested.  

$60/dose. LC1  

### Creeping Doom

A follow-up blood agent that causes a greenish black pestilence to radiate outward from the injection site.  The necrosis spreads fairly quickly, visibly killing tissue.  The onset time is 1d-1 hours with follow-up effects every hour after that.  The only known non-magical way to stop the spread is to excise (physically cut away) the toxic tissue and cauterize the area with heat.   

The victim must make a HT-3 roll at on-set and every hour after that.  This toxin has no end duration.  It continues to spread until cut away, cured, or the victim dies. On a failed HT-3 roll the victim suffers 1 pt damage and 1 pt fatigue that cannot be healed or recovered until the poisoning is cured or the poisoned tissue is cut away.  The damage is applied at the injection site.  If that is a limb, the damage continues to be applied to that limb until it is crippled.  After that, the damage is applied to the torso.  After the victim reaches HP/2 they must also make a HT roll every hour to avoid suffering from Pain and Nausea (see B.428).   

**Production**: Cultivated from black algae around natural hot springs that is mixed with Orc feces and allowed to “ferment” in a clay pot buried in the ground for 2 weeks.  The resulting paste is pitch black and hideous smelling.  Concentrated whiffs require a HT+2 roll to avoid retching for 3d seconds. (Naturalist roll to find proper algae and Poisons -3 roll to mix proper ratios and “ferment” correctly).  

$50/dose.  LC1.  

### Curare

A follow-up blood agent, curare is is made from crushing and boiling down the leaves of certain uncommon tropical flowers, until a thick brown paste remains.  Curare has an on-set time of 3d seconds and recurs every 1d seconds for 2d cycles.  The victim must make a HT-2 roll to avoid paralysis.  The paralysis typically starts in the extremities and works its way towards the body.  

Roll randomly on the table below.  
  
**Curare Paralysis Progression**  

|Roll|First Location|Second Location|Third Location|Fourth Location|Fifth Location|  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
|1|Right hand|Right arm|Torso|Vitals|Vitals|  
|2|Left hand|Left arm|Torso|Vitals|Vitals|  
|3|Right foot|Right leg|Groin|Torso|Vitals|  
|4|Left foot|Left leg|Groin|Torso|Vitals|  
|5|Mouth|Eyes|Head|Neck|Vitals|  
|6|Ears|Eyes|Head|Neck|Vitals|  

Each roll for location builds upon the previous roll.  For example, Joe has been poisoned with Curare.  He fails his first health roll and rolls 1d to see which location the curare affects first.  He gets a 1, so his right hand is paralyzed.  A minute later he rolls against his HT again and fails that roll also.  He rolls for the second affected location and gets a 3, so his right foot is paralyzed.  A minute later he fails his third HT roll, and rolls for affected location and gets 1 again.  He's already rolled a 1 before that left his right hand paralyzed, so now the poison progresses up his right arm.  

Each location affected by the poison is treated as crippled (see B. 421).  If the effects reach the vitals, the victim is in danger of suffocating due to paralysis of the diaphragm.  The victim must make an additional HT roll when the vitals are reached.  On a failure the victim stops breathing (see suffocating B. 436).  

**Production**: The correct plants must be harvested fresh from their tropical locations (naturalist skill roll), ground with a mortar and pestle, and then carefully boiled over a low heat to reduce and concentrate the toxins (Poisons -1 roll).  

$75/dose. LC1.  

### Demon Ant Venom

Similar to Tarantula Hawk Venom, but worse.  This is a follow-up poison with a 1d-3 second on-set time and an hourly recurrence for 4d intervals.  Every hour the victim must make a HT-4 roll.  On a success the victim experiences “terrible pain” and on a failure they experience “agony” (see B.428).  On a critical success they feel only “moderate pain” and on a critical failure they fall unconscious from the pain.  

**Production**: Must be harvested.  1 ant produces one dose.  

$120/dose.  LC 1.  

### Jumping Spider Venom

This poison has an onset time of 1d seconds.  It causes loss of motor control & extreme pain (cytotoxic) – begins to liquefy (pre-digest) tissue to make it easier for the spiders to slurp out the nutrients.  The victim must make a HT roll or suffer 1d toxic damage specific to bite location repeating every 5 minutes for 2d intervals.  
On a critical failure the victim takes double damage, and on a critical success the effects of the poison end.  Limbs may be crippled by this damage (See Crippling Injury B.420).  

**Production**: Must be harvested from live spiders.  Each spider can generate 3-6 doses per day.  

$90/dose. LC 1  

### Poison Arrow Frog Venom

A blood agent or a digestive agent with an onset time of 1d minutes or 3d minutes respectively.  In either case the victim must make a HT-2 roll to resist.  On a failure, the user starts hallucinating (see Incapacitating Conditions - Hallucinations B.429).  This lasts for hours equal to the margin of failure. After that time, the user may roll vs. HT-2 once per hour to shake off the drug’s influence.  

**Production**: must be harvested from the backs of small tropical frogs (Naturalist -2 roll), and then reduced and concentrated for storage and use (Poisons skill roll).  

$25/dose. LC1  

### Tarantula Hawk Venom

Similar to Demon Ant Venom, but faster acting, with a shorter duration and only slightly less painful.  A fast venom, the onset time is 1 second.  The venom causes “immediate, excruciating, unrelenting pain that simply shuts down one's ability to do anything, except scream.” The poison causes no actual permanent damage.  

Victims must make a HT roll to resist the effects which last 1d minutes.  On a failed HT roll the victim suffers “terrible pain” centered on the injection point and on a success they experience “severe pain” (see B.428).  On a critical success they feel only “mild pain” and on a critical failure they experience “agony”.   

**Production**: Must be harvested.  Tarantula Hawks (a type of large wasp) are native to desert lands and rare except in brief rainy seasons.  

$100/dose. LC 1.  

## Contact Agents  

### The Long Sleep

This poison is harvested from Hangman's Vine, it readily absorbs through the skin and causes the victim to rapidly fall unconscious.  It is a clear viscous liquid that is orderless and tasteless.  It may be absorbed through the skin, injected or ingested.  Regardless of delivery mechanism, it takes effect in 1d seconds.  The victim must make a HT roll every second for 3d seconds.  Each failed HT roll causes 1d fatigue (see B.426).  Fatigue is recovered normally after the poison wears off.

Production: must be carefully harvested from the vines (naturalist -2 roll to locate; poisons roll to harvest).  

$30/dose. LC 1  

### Lover's Kiss

A bright red paste that is easily absorbed through the skin, it is made from the concentrated mash of the berries of the Belladonna plant and which is mixed with reduced assassin snail slime and allowed to cure in a cool damp cellar for several weeks.  The on-set time for this toxin is 3d+2 minutes, with follow-up effects every 1 hour for 4d hours.  The victim must make a HT roll when the effects start and every hour after to resist.  On a Success the victim suffers no effects, but on a failure the victim goes into a [catatonic stupor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupor), similar to being dazed, but they barely react even to pain or injury. (see Dazed B.428).  The victim remains in the stupor until the next HT roll an hour later.  On a critical success the effects of the poison ends; but on a critical failure then poisons effects continue for an extra 1d hours.  

If the victim suffers from catatonic stupor, once they recover from that bought of catatonia (even if the poison is still active), they must make a HT roll with a penalty equal to number continuous hours that they were dazed.  If they succeed, they suffer no additional negative effects, but the poison may still have follow-up cycles remaining.  A failed HT roll means the victim has lost some memories (both declarative memory and non declarative memory).  The victim loses 1 month of memories and 1 skill point (roll randomly for affected skills) equal to number of hours they were catatonic.  On a critical failure the victim suffers from total amnesia and losses skill points equal to twice the number of hours they were catatonic.  

**Production**: Naturalist roll to locate and harvest collect the correct berries and assassin snail slime; and a Poisons roll to mix the proper ratios and cure correctly.  

$40/dose.  LC 1.  

## Digestive Agents

### Cerbera

A fine powder made from seeds of the Odallam tree, commonly known as the suicide tree. The seeds contain cerberin, a potent toxin that causes disruption of the heartbeat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices, such as a curry. It is often used in homicide and suicide in certain parts of the world.  

The onset time for this poison is 2d hours and requires a HT roll.  If the victim fails the roll they suffer an immediate heart attack (see heart attach B.429).  If the victim succeeds, they suffer no ill-effects and will likely not even know they have been poisoned.  

**Production**: Harvest dry, and grind the seeds (Naturalist roll to find the trees and Poisons roll to harvest and refine).  

$30/dose.  LC1.  

### Destroying Angels

The destroying angels poison is a concentrated extract of several species of all-white mushrooms in the genus Amanita. These incredibly toxic fungi are very similar in appearance to edible button mushrooms and the meadow mushrooms and have been collected by mistake on numerous occasions.  

As a digestive agent, the symptoms take 4d hours to present and last for 1d days.  The poison impairs normal brain function lowering the victim’s intelligence.  Once the effects begin the victim must make a HT-2 roll every hour or lose 1 point of IQ.  Once the victim reaches an IQ of 3 or lower, he stops losing IQ and slips into a coma (see B.429).  Once the toxin wears off, if the victim was in a coma, they awaken with an IQ of 3.  They must make a HT roll daily to recover 1 pt of IQ.  On a failure IQ is not recovered, on a critical failure 1 pt of IQ is lost permanently.  

**Production**: Naturalist-3 to find the right mushrooms and Poisons roll to dry, grind and mix properly.  

$30/dose.  LC 1.  

### Hemlock

This poison is made simply from crushing the roots of the Water Hemlock plant into a paste.  Once a victim ingests the poison the on-set time is 1d+14 minutes with follow-up effects every 2 hours for 3d+6 cycles.  The victim must make a HT roll at on set and during each cycle afterwards.  On a success the victim suffers on nausea and drowsiness (see B.428).  On a critical success the victim suffers no further effects from the poison.  If the victim fails the HT roll, they progress through the effects noted below:

|Failure|Effect|
|---|---|
|First|Retching (see B.428)|
|Second|Retching and Pain (see B.428)|
|Third|Seizures (see B.428)|
|Fourth|Coma (see B.428)|  

Once an effect has begun, it continues with only brief moments of respite, even if the next HT roll is made.  That just means symptoms don't get worse.  They only ways to end the symptoms are:
1.	To survive until the poison runs its course
2.	Use magic to cure poison
3.	Make a critical success on the HT roll

**Production**: Steeping the newest, youngest, leaves from the Hemlock plant (Naturalist roll to locate) in hot water for 24 hours, and then carefully reducing the extracted down by a factor of 10 to produce a concentrated syrup (Poisons roll).  

$25/dose. LC1.  

### King's Dessert (Arsenic)

Mined from a special soft gray mineral and ground into a fine powder this is a digestive agent with a one-hour delay and a HT-2 roll to resist. Inflicts 1d toxic damage, repeating at hourly intervals for eight cycles.  

**Production**: Naturalist-2 or Geology roll to locate the appropriate minerals, followed by a Poisons roll to effectively filter out the impurities.    

$50/dose. LC1.  

### Poison Arrow Frog Venom

A blood agent or a digestive agent with an onset time of 1d minutes or 3d minutes respectively.  In either case the victim must make a HT-2 roll to resist.  On a failure, the user starts hallucinating (see Incapacitating Conditions - Hallucinations B.429).  This lasts for a number of hours equal to the margin of failure. After that time, the user may roll vs. HT-2 once per hour to shake off the drug’s influence. On a critical failure the victim acquires a 15-point phobia as a result of the hallucinations.  On a success the victim suffers no ill-effects.  

**Production**: must be harvested from the backs of small tropical frogs (Naturalist -2 roll), and then reduced and concentrated for storage and use (Poisons skill roll).  

$25/dose. LC1

### Red Tide

Harvested and distilled from certain shellfish following the Red Tides.  It has a delay of 3dx2 minutes, after which there is slight tingling around the mouth, progressing to numbness which spreads to face and neck to moderate cases.  The victim must make a HT-3 roll or suffer a DX penalty equal to the failure margin due to partial muscle paralysis.  The symptoms last for 2d6 hours.  On a critical failure the victim is completely paralyzed (flaccid) and must make an additional health roll every hour or die from suffocation.  If the victim survives the period of active symptoms, they will begin to recover.  They must make a HT roll every 6 hours to regain 1 point of DX.  There are no negative consequences for a regular failure on the health roll, recovery just take longer, but on a critical failure, DX is permanently reduced by 1.  

**Production**:  

$20/dose. LC1.  

## Respiratory Agents

### Blood Berry Powder

This toxin, made from the deep purple “blood berries” of the collabra variety of the nightshade bush, must be inhaled to have an effect.  It is commonly stored in small wooden tubes about the size of a man's pinky finger with both ends plugged by small wads of cloth, with a cord running out and covered with wax.  The ends of the tube are opened by pulling the small cords.  Then the user blows through the tube forcing the powder out.  The powder forms a cloud 1 yard in diameter that persists for 1d seconds.  

Once inhaled, the poison has an on-set time of 1d-1 seconds with a follow-up cycle every 1 minute for 3d minutes.  The victim must make a HT-1 roll every minute or they bleed from all of their bodily orifices losing 2 HP.  Bleeding from the mouth and nose causes coughing and gagging (see coughing B.428), and bleeding from the eyes interferes with vision (-3 to vision rolls).  On a success, they suffer no blood loss or damage during that cycle.  On a critical success, the effects of the poison end, and on a critical failure the victim begins to bleed from the pores of their skin and suffer 1d damage for that cycle.  The bleeding itself causes no pain.  

**Production**: Naturalist roll to locate and collect the correct berries.  Poisons roll to dry, grind and make into powder properly.  

$80/dose. LC1.  

### Devil's Incense

This toxic vapor is made from combining Alay salts collected from around geysers, hot springs, and volcanos with Oil of Vitriol.  When the 2 are combined in the proper ratios, the ingredients are consumed and release a gas with a faint blue/green tint.  

Anyone breathing this vapor must immediately make a HT-2 roll or take 1 HP of toxic damage.  The victim must roll again every second for as long as they remain in the area of the gas.  The gas naturally disperses after 3d+2 seconds.  Each dose fills 2 yard radius, 2 yards high.  

This poison is commonly delivered in small (~2” diameter) ceramic balls, that have 2 chambers inside separated by a small glass partition.  The crystals are loaded into one chamber and the liquid into the other.  Both chambers are sealed with wax plugs.  The sphere can be thrown and crushed to release the cloud of toxic gas at the desired location.  

**Production**: Naturalist roll to collect Salts, chemistry roll to acquire Oil of Vitriol and poisons roll to grind salts correctly and combine in the proper proportions.  

$55/dose.  LC1.  

### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

A very fine powder made from a special mix of the dried seeds of the imperial pepper plant, finely ground essential cinnamon, fine alkaline powder, and dried crystallized spitting cobra venom.  This toxin is typically delivered by either sprinkling it in the air around the target or having a small amount in a porous cloth pouch that lets the powder out when it's squeezed or impacted.  The porous cloth pouches are commonly tightly wrapped in a waxed cloth to contain the powder, and the cloth is removed before forcing the powder out of the porous sack.  

A dose is commonly enough to fill a 2-yard sphere with enough powder to affect a SM 0 creature.  Once the powder is in the air it persists in the same area for 2d-2 minutes.  Anyone breathing in that volume automatically inhales the powder.  

The on-set time is immediate, and the victim must make a HT-2 roll or begin to sneeze and cough uncontrollably for a number of seconds equal to the margin of failure (see B.428).  In addition to sneezing and coughing the victims eyes and nose also run giving a -2 to all vision and smell rolls.  On a critical failure, the victim begins choking and continues choking until they make a HT-2 (one attempt per second) roll to resist the powders effects – the good news is they stop sneezing a coughing while they are choking.  On a successful HT-2 roll the victim suffers no effects for that round.  On a critical success the victim suffers no further effects from the powder.  

**Production**: Naturalist rolls x4 to locate the correct ingredients and a poisons -2 roll to prepare and combine the ingredients properly.  

$50/dose.  LC1.  

### Happy Smoke

This poison is an oily liquid made from concentrated Oleander oil and extract of crushed Jimson Weed leaves.  The liquid itself is not toxic and has a pleasant “green” floral scent.  However, when heated, the smoke released from the oil has a string narcotic effect on those that inhale it.  Frequently things like candle or lantern wicks, torch rags, are incense sticks are soaked in this oil.  

A person must take several breaths of this gas in order to be exposed to its effects.  If the person is resting this means they must be in the area of the gas for 10 seconds normally, 6 seconds if slightly exerted and 3 seconds if they have been heavily exerting themselves.  

Once the victim has been sufficiently exposed, the on-set time is 1d minutes, with a follow-up every hour while they are exposed to the smoke, and 1dx10 minutes after they end their exposure.  

While they are under the influence, victims must make a HT roll during each cycle or become increasingly intoxicated.  Each failure shifts you one level from sober to tipsy to drunk to unconscious (drunken stupor) to coma; see Afflictions (p. 428) for details. A critical failure drops you two levels: sober to drunk, tipsy to unconscious, or drunk to coma.  A critical success reduces your intoxication by one level.  

One dose is enough to generate enough vapor to fill a 3-yard radius, 3 yards high for one hour.  

**Production**:
