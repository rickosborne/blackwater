# Calendar  	

## Epoch
The Heliconian calendar still used in Blackwater, counts the years from the founding of Heliconia, over 850 years ago.  Most of the cities that were once part of the Helic empire still use the calendar.  Years are noted as Annae Pax Heliconium (APH) after the founding of the imperial city, or Annae Anti Heliconium (AAH) for years preceding the founding.  

## History  
The Heliconian calendar was created over three hundred years ago by the Herstotile Brothers. The Brothers are a religious order that founded the Ordinal Cathedral in the ancient city of Heliconium. The calendar dates from the fall of Heliconian at the end of the Grokim Wars. The calendar contains 365 days, divided into 12 months. Each month contains 30 days, divided into 5 weeks of 6 days each.   

The months are: 
- Fireseek  
- Coldeven  
- Readying  
- Planting  
- Flocktime  
- Wealsun  
- Reaping  
- Goodmonth  
- Harvest  
- Patchwall  
- Belltine

The days of the week are: Lundi, Delmi, Samdi, Fellodi, Bochdi, Holidi. Holidi is the typical day of worship and rest.

## Holidays  
The Largest and most popular Holiday is Annae Annue. Itâ€™s the celebration of the New Year. Traditional celebrations include many feasts, family gatherings, the exchanging of gifts and the worship of the gods.  It is universally regarded as a time of peace and friendship, and only the most despicable and heinous of fiends would do violence or cause harm during the season.
