# Rules  
## Rule Books  

Material from any GURPS source book that fits the classic fantasy motif of Blackwater, and 150-200 point power level may be used, within reason and subject to GM concurrence.

In general, the following GURPS sourcebooks are recommended:  

•	[GURPS Basic Set - Characters](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules except Chapter 6, Psionics.  
•	[GURPS Basic Set - Campaigns](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules for TL3  
•	[GURPS Magic](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Magic/): All rules except no Technology College, and no Clerical Magic (priests have Powers, not spells). Also, Improv Magic, Syntactic Magic and Symbol Magic are very rare among humanoid mages.  
•	[GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fanatasy/): Racial templates for Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings all apply directly.  Everything else may be used for inspiration.  
•	[Martial Arts](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/MartialArts/): Realistic skills, techniques, styles, and combinations are available to characters with an unusual background.  As well as some Chi Powers, limited cinematic skills (subject to discussion), and Trained by a Master / Weapon Master advantages.  
•	[Low Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/LowTech/): All rules and most equipment (subject to discussion) is available.  
•	[Dungeon Fantasy 1 - Adventurers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful character templates, but need to be scaled down from 250 point to 150 points.  
•	[Dungeon Fantasy 5 - Allies](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful for animal companions, familiars, etc.  
•	[Powers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/): Good inspiration for building powers for Priests, and other characters with uncommon non-magical gifts.  
•	[Divine Favor](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/divinefavor/): Rules for some (mostly non-human priests).  

## House Rules
•	Characters may start with 100% of their wealth to spend on equipment, if they are homeless and it fits with their story line (see B26).  
•	Extra Effort in Combat rules are allowed (B357)  
•	Use the Dice + Adds optional rule (B269)  
•	Speed load (weapon/ammo type) skill lets you reload your weapon as a free action.  A failed skill role means it takes the usual amount of time.  A critical failure means you drop the ammo.  
•	Fast Draw skill exists for ammunition as well as weapons.  Combining with the speed load skill means a player can retrieve ammo and load it into his weapon as 2 back-to-back free actions in the same round – slightly cinematic, but fun.  
•	Players can use an unspent character point to immediately reroll any dice roll for their character.  This includes skills, defenses, reactions, or rolls made for the player by the GM (e.g. knowledge spells / skills).  Players may make multiple rerolls per attempted action, but each time they do the point cost doubles (1 point on the first re-roll, 2 points on the second, 4 points on the third, etc.)  
•	Differential Size modifies for melee combat as discussed at http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/faq/FAQ4-3.html#SS3.4.2.23  
<blockquote>Normally, the size modifier of your opponent is applied to your attack roll, whatever yours is. The problem is in some cases, it causes a big problem; for example, two ants (SM -10) have practically no chance of hitting each other unless they have Brawling-20+. To correct this, a new optional rule has been introduced:
When two opponents face each other in melee combat, apply the difference in size modifiers as a bonus to the smallest attacker and as a penalty to the biggest. However, the bonus to a small opponent is limited to +4; attacking a wall ten times as big as you is no easier than hitting a wall four times as big – your reach limits where you can hit.</blockquote>
