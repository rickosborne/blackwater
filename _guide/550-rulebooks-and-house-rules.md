In general, the following GURPS sourcebooks are recommended:  
•	[GURPS Basic Set - Characters](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules except Chapter 6, Psionics.  
•	[GURPS Basic Set - Campaigns](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules for TL3  
•	[GURPS Magic](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Magic/): All rules except no Technology College, and no Clerical Magic (priests have Powers, not spells). Also, Improv Magic, Syntactic Magic and Symbol Magic are very rare among humanoid mages.  
•	[GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fanatasy/): Racial templates for Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings all apply directly.  Everything else may be used for inspiration.  
•	[Martial Arts](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/MartialArts/): Realistic skills, techniques, styles, and combinations are available to characters with an unusual background.  As well as some Chi Powers, limited cinematic skills (subject to discussion), and Trained by a Master / Weapon Master advantages.  
•	[Low Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/LowTech/): All rules and most equipment (subject to discussion) is available.  
•	[Dungeon Fantasy 1 - Adventurers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful character templates, but need to be scaled down from 250 point to 150 points.  
•	[Dungeon Fantasy 5 - Allies](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful for animal companions, familiars, etc.  
•	[Powers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/): Good inspiration for building powers for Priests, and other characters with uncommon non-magical gifts.  
•	[Divine Favor](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/divinefavor/): Rules for some (mostly non-human priests).
