# Rules

## Rule Books

Material from any GURPS source book that fits the classic fantasy motif of Blackwater, and 150-200 point power level may be used, within reason and subject to GM concurrence.

In general, the following GURPS sourcebooks are recommended:  

* [GURPS Basic Set - Characters](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules except Chapter 6, Psionics.  
* [GURPS Basic Set - Campaigns](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/): all rules for TL3  
* [GURPS Magic](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Magic/): All rules except no Technology College, and no Clerical Magic (priests have Powers, not spells). Also, Improv Magic, Syntactic Magic and Symbol Magic are very rare among humanoid mages.  
* [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fanatasy/): Racial templates for Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings all apply directly.  Everything else may be used for inspiration.  
* [Martial Arts](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/MartialArts/): Realistic skills, techniques, styles, and combinations are available to characters with an unusual background.  As well as some Chi Powers, limited cinematic skills (subject to discussion), and Trained by a Master / Weapon Master advantages.  
* [Low Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/LowTech/): All rules and most equipment (subject to discussion) is available.  
* [Dungeon Fantasy 1 - Adventurers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful character templates, but need to be scaled down from 250 point to 150 points.  
* [Dungeon Fantasy 5 - Allies](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/dungeonfantasy/): Useful for animal companions, familiars, etc.  
* [Powers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/): Good inspiration for building powers for Priests, and other characters with uncommon non-magical gifts.  
* [Divine Favor](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/divinefavor/): Rules for some (mostly non-human priests).  

## House Rules

* Characters may start with 100% of their wealth to spend on equipment, if they are homeless and it fits with their story line (see B26).  
* Extra Effort in Combat rules are allowed (B357)  
* Use the Dice + Adds optional rule (B269)  
* Speed load (weapon/ammo type) skill lets you reload your weapon as a free action.
  A failed skill role means it takes the usual amount of time.
  A critical failure means you drop the ammo.  
* Fast Draw skill exists for ammunition as well as weapons.
  Combining with the speed load skill means a player can retrieve ammo and load it into his weapon as 2 back-to-back free actions in the same round – slightly cinematic, but fun.  
* Players can use an unspent character point to immediately reroll any dice roll for their character.
  This includes skills, defenses, reactions, or rolls made for the player by the GM (e.g. knowledge spells / skills).
  Players may make multiple rerolls per attempted action, but each time they do the point cost doubles (1 point on the first re-roll, 2 points on the second, 4 points on the third, etc.)  
* Differential Size modifies for melee combat as discussed in the [GURPS FAQ &#167;3.4.2.23](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/faq/FAQ4-3.html#SS3.4.2.23).

> Normally, the size modifier of your opponent is applied to your attack roll, whatever yours is.
> The problem is in some cases, it causes a big problem; for example, two ants (SM -10) have practically no chance of hitting each other unless they have Brawling-20+.
> To correct this, a new optional rule has been introduced:
>
> When two opponents face each other in melee combat, apply the difference in size modifiers as a bonus to the smallest attacker and as a penalty to the biggest.
> However, the bonus to a small opponent is limited to +4; attacking a wall ten times as big as you is no easier than hitting a wall four times as big – your reach limits where you can hit.

### Alternate Magic Rituals
These are an expansion of the Optional Rule: Alternate Magic Rituals on [Magic](https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/magic/) P.9  

Casting Time Modifiers (quick & dirty vs. slow and deliberate casting): 
  
|Modifier  |Effect                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|-1 Sec    |-5 to Skill (1 Sec minimum, except for blocking spells)|
|+1 Sec    |+ 1 to skill, up to +3                                 |  

Energy Modifiers (extra effort vs. phone-it-in casting):    
  
|Modifier|Effect|
|---|---|
|-1 FP|-2 to Skill (Can’t reduce fatigue cost by more than 50%)|
|+1 FP|+ 1 to skill, up to +3|  

Physical Ritual Modifiers (Macarena vs. Plank casting):  
By default, all spells require two-handed gestures, subtle foot motions like dance steps, and a clearly spoken incantation.  
  
|Modifier|Effect|
|---|---|
|Grand, dramatic whole-body movements|+1 to Skill|
|Omitting the foot movements|-2 to Skill|
|Gestures with only one hand|-2 to Skill|
|no hand gestures|-4 to Skill|  

Verbal Ritual Modifiers:      
   
|Modifier|Effect|
|---|---|
|Yelling / Screaming|+2 to Skill|
|Speaking loudly and articulately|+1 to Skill|
|Softly spoken incantations|-2 to Skill|
|No spoken incantation|-4 to Skill|  

### Alternate Ceremonies  
These rules modify the Ceremonial Magic rules on Magic p.12.  Mages may cast ceremonies at an effective skill of 15 or less.  However, the guidelines on how much energy each participant can contribute still apply.  
 
### Spell Defaults
Many spells have a default skill, so even if you don't *really* know the spell you can give it a try.  Defaulting a spell can be done from any other spell with the following modifiers:   
- Base -2 to skill because it's a default.    
- An additional -2 to skill for "step" away from the known spell to the one trying the make a default roll.  "Steps" are determined by tracing a path from the known spell to the unknown spell on the [Magic Spell Charts](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-magic-spell-charts).  
- An additional -1 for each Prerequisite spell that is missing   
- An additional -1 for "Very Hard" spells  
- Spells cast as a default cost +1 fatigue in addition to their normal base cost  
- Minimum Magery prerequisites always apply  
  
You have to know at least one spell in the College of the spell your trying to default to.  In other words, you can't cross-college default.  

**Example 1**:  
> Del wants to try casting "Rain of Ice Daggers" using a default skill.  He has Ice Dagger at 15.  Rain of Ice Daggers is only 1 step away from Ice Dagger on the  spell 
> chart, so his skill modifier starts at -2 for a default casting, and an additional -2 for the spell being 1 step away.  But, because Dell doesn't know Hail, Snow, or Clouds 
> or the any 2 Air spells required for Clouds, he's missing 5 prerequisites, so that's an additional -5 to skill for a total -9.  Dell would need to roll a 6 or less to 
> successfully default cast Rain of Ice Daggers.   

**Example 2**:   
> Del wants to try casting Continual Light using a default skill.  Continual Light is only 1 step away from Light, which Dell knows at 15. So, Dell would have the basic 
> penalty of -2 for a default casting, and a -2 because Continual Light is only 1 step away from Light.  Dell could attempt a default casting of Continual Light at -4 to 
> skill, or an 11.

### Power Stones
In general, precious gems, because of their inherent properties (mineral structure, translucence, and ability to interact with magical energy) are better able to hold Mana and therefore to serve as powerstones.

The Powerstone enchantment works exactly as described in the magic sourcebook, with the exception that the typical maximum Mana capacity of a given gem is simply calculated as the square root of the Mana Affinity times the number of carats of the stone:  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Capacity = \sqrt{Mana\:Affinity * Mass}" align="center">
  
| Gem Name | Mana Affinity(per Ct) | Base Value (per Ct) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Agate** | 1.25 | 25 | A smooth, banded mineral. The changing colors highlight depth when the gem is carved, so it&#39;s often used for tiny reliefs. |
| **Amber** | 6.25 | 125 | A yellow-orange material, sometimes with long-dead insects and other very tiny organisms trapped in it. |
| **Amethyst** | 7.5 | 150 | Transparent, purple quartz. |
| **Aquamarine** | 7.5 | 150 | Transparent and pale blue, aquamarine is naturally associated with water. |
| **Azurite** | 2.5 | 50 | A blue ore of copper. |
| **Beryl** | 7.5 | 150 | A hard, transparent gem, colorless or yellow, similar to emerald and aquamarine. |
| **Bloodstone** | 7.5 | 150 | A dark, opaque stone with red streaks. |
| **Calcite** | 5 | 100 | Gem-quality calcite is a cloudy white stone, but it may be transparent from some angles and can be carved into lenses. |
| **Cat&#39;s Eye** | 7.5 | 150 | A form of beryl that focuses light in a distinctive streak down the center. |
| **Chalcedony** | 2.5 | 50 | A milky, usually white stone. |
| **Coral** | 5 | 100 | Opaque remains of live coral, polished and often carved into shapes. |
| **Diamond** | 10 | 200 | |
| **Emerald** | 8.75 | 175 | A brilliant-green stone. |
| **Garnet** | 8.75 | 175 | Usually red, but rare green and other colors of garnets exist. |
| **Hematite** | 1.25 | 25 | A silvery iron ore with a crystaline structure. |
| **Iolite** | 7.5 | 150 | A thin piece of this sapphire-like mineral polarizes light, so it can be used to reduce glare. |
| **Jade** | 5 | 100 | Usually green, though sometimes shading into white (and, very rarely, other colors), high-quality jade is somewhat translucent. Jade is an extremely tough mineral that can, in large enough chunks, be used for high-quality stone axes. |
| **Jet** | 2.5 | 50 | A black stone that takes a polish, though it&#39;s essentially just an exceptionally dense form of coal. |
| **Lapis Lazuli** | 6.25 | 125 | A soft, dark-blue stone, often streaked with gold pyrites. |
| **Magnetite** | 1.25 | 25 | A silvery iron ore. |
| **Malachite** | 3.75 | 75 | A deep-green copper ore, often streaked with swirls of lighter green. |
| **Moonstone** | 7.5 | 150 | A very pearlescent stone appearing in several colors. Some have tiger-eye or star-like appearance. |
| **Obsidian** | 0.5 | 10 | Volcanic glass, usually black or very dark green. Like jade, it is slightly translucent and can be sharpened. |
| **Onyx** | 5 | 100 | Black, opaque quartz. |
| **Opal** | 8.75 | 175 | Opal comes in a variety of shades and levels of opacity, but its most notable attribute is that it diffracts light internally, giving it deep, rainbow-colored overtones. |
| **Pearl** | 8.75 | 175 | Pearls are typically white with a faint rainbow sheen, but they can be tinged pink or purple as well. |
| **Peridot** | 7.5 | 150 | A pale, transparent, green stone, sometimes found in meteors. |
| **Quartz** | 3.75 | 75 | Clear quartz is relatively common, so quartz crystals and carvings have often been used as magical adjuncts. |
| **Ruby** | 8.75 | 175 | A very hard, transparent, red stone. |
| **Sapphire** | 8.75 | 175 | Often blue, but can be any color except red. It is the same stone as ruby, only with different trace elements providing color. |
| **Sard** | 6.25 | 125 | An opaque, red quartz, often carved into seals. |
| **Topaz** | 8.75 | 175 | Usually earth-toned, but blue, green, and multi-colored topazes exist. |
| **Tourmaline** | 6.25 | 125 | A translucent stone usually found in long, narrow crystals made of multicolored bands. |
| **Turquoise** | 5 | 100 | A pale blue-green, opaque mineral, sometimes mottled with darker colors. |
